## About me

Hello! I'm Philipp Ross and I'm currently a computational biologist working in the [Llin√°s Lab](http://llinaslab.psu.edu/) at the Pennsylvania State University. My lab works on transcriptional regulation and metabolic plasticity in the deadliest human infecting parasite that causes malaria, Plasmodium falciparum.

Here's a link to my [curriculum vitae](./_docs/Ross_Philipp_CV.pdf) for those that are interested.
