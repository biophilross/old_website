## About

Hello! I'm Philipp Ross and I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Chicago in the [Molecular Biosciences](http://bmb.bsd.uchicago.edu/) program.

I'm also a former computational biologist in the [Llin√°s Lab](http://llinaslab.psu.edu/) at the Pennsylvania State University where Manuel's lab works on understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and metabolic plasticity in the deadliest human infecting parasite that causes malaria, *Plasmodium falciparum*.

Here's a link to my [curriculum vitae](./docs/Ross_Philipp_CV.pdf) for those that are interested.

Also, sometimes my gists are useful: [https://gist.github.com/thephilross](https://gist.github.com/thephilross)
