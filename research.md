## Research

I'm currently applying to graduate programs that incorporate the following flavors of research:

* Molecular evolution
* Genomics & Systems Biology
* Biological design and synthetic biology

I'm particularly interested in exploring the molecular diversity of non-model organisms and how that can aid our ability to program cells.
