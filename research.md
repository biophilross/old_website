## Research

I'm currently applying to graduate programs that incorporate the following flavors of research:

* Molecular evolution
* Genomics & systems biology
* Biological design & synthetic biology

I'm particularly interested in exploring the molecular diversity of non-model organisms to better understand the mechanisms behind molecular evolution events and to enhance our ability to program cells.
