## Research

I'm interested in working at the interface of molecular and evolutionary biology. More specifically, I'm interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms that give rise to evolutionary novelties at the cellular, organismal, and ecological scale.

I will be starting my tenure at the University of Chicago as a graduate student in the [Molecular Biosciences](http://bmb.bsd.uchicago.edu/) program starting in the Fall of 2016.
